 This study suggests a novel bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm (MA) called the Python Snake Optimization Algorithm (PySOA), which simulates the Python snake hunting mechanism in nature. 
 
 To run this code
 
You should run the main file and change the fitness function at every run time.
 You can control the main parameters in the main file (such as Max Iteration, Number of runtime, etc.).
 The methodology of PySOA, you can find it in the PySOA file, also you can control the PySOA's parameters (such as density of pheromone, Infrared Radiation, Eyesight Vision, etc.).
