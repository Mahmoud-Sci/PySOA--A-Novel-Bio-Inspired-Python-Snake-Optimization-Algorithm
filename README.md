 This study suggests a novel bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm (MA) called the Python Snake Optimization Algorithm (PySOA), which simulates the Python snake hunting mechanism in nature. 
 
 To run this code
 
- You should run the main file and change the fitness function at every run time.

- You can control the main parameters in the main file (such as Max Iteration, Number of runtime, etc.).
 
- The methodology of PySOA, you can find it in the PySOA file, also you can control the PySOA's parameters (such as density of pheromone, Infrared Radiation, Eyesight Vision, etc.).
